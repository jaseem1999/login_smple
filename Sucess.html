                <h3>BLACK BOX TESTING</h3>
                <p>Black box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering
                    into its internal structures
                    or workings. It is also known as behavioral testing, functional testing, or structural testing. Black box testing is
                    usually a functional testing method,
                    but it can also be a structural testing method.</p>
                
                <p>Black box testing is a software testing method in which the internal
                    structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester.</p>
                
                <p>In other words, the tester does not know how the software is built. The tester only knows the input, the output,
                    and the performance of the software. The tester does not know the code. Black box testing is also known as
                    functional testing,
                    behavioral testing, or structural testing. Black box testing is usually a functional testing method,
                    but it can also be a structural testing method.</p>
